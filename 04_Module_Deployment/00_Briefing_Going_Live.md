# Mission 0: The Production Mindset

## Objective

Understand the difference between "working on localhost" and "working on the internet."

## Key Concepts

- **Localhost vs. Production:** Your computer vs. a server in a data center.
- **Environment Parity:** Making dev, staging, and production as similar as possible.
- **Containers:** Packaging your app with all its dependencies.

## The Task

Understand what changes when you deploy to production.

## Steps

1.  **The Checklist:**
    - **Prompt:** "I'm about to deploy a FastAPI + React app to production. Create a deployment checklist covering: environment variables, database persistence, CORS, HTTPS, and secrets management."
2.  **Study the Checklist:**
    - Read each item. Ask the AI to explain any unfamiliar terms.
3.  **Docker Overview:**
    - **Prompt:** "Explain Docker to me like I'm 12. Why do developers use containers instead of just running Python directly on a server?"

## Success Criteria

You understand the checklist and can explain what Docker solves.
