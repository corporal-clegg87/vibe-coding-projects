# Mission 0: Understanding AI Agents

## Objective

Learn the difference between using AI as a tool vs. building autonomous agents.

## Key Concepts

- **Agent:** A program that can perceive, decide, and act with some autonomy.
- **Tool Use:** AIs can now call functions and APIs.
- **Context Management:** The art of giving AI the right information at the right time.
- **Agentic Loop:** Observe → Think → Act → Repeat.

## The Task

Research and understand modern AI agent architectures.

## Steps

1.  **Study Examples:**
    - **Prompt:** "Explain the difference between a chatbot and an AI agent. Give examples of what agents can do that chatbots cannot."
2.  **Explore `.cursorrules`:**
    - **Prompt:** "What is a `.cursorrules` file? How do developers use it to customize Cursor's behavior?"
3.  **Agent Files:**
    - **Prompt:** "Explain the concept of 'agent files' or 'system prompts' that define an AI's behavior and expertise."
4.  **Create a Specification:**
    - **Prompt:** "I want to build a self-correcting script runner. It should: 1. Accept a task description, 2. Generate Python code, 3. Run it, 4. If it errors, read the error and try to fix itself, 5. Limit to 3 retry attempts. Help me outline the architecture."

## Success Criteria

You have an `architecture.md` document outlining the self-correcting agent's components: task parser, code generator, executor, error analyzer, and retry loop.
