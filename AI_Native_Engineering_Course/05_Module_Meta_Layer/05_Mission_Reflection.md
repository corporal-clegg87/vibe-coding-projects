# Mission 5: The Philosophy of Agentic Coding

## Objective

Reflect on what you've learned and understand the future of software development.

## Key Concepts

- **Human-in-the-Loop:** When to let AI decide vs. when to intervene.
- **Limits of Automation:** What still requires human judgment.
- **The Architect's Role:** Your job in an AI-powered world.

## The Task

Write a reflection document and plan your next project.

## Steps

1.  **Reflection Questions:**
    - What tasks are you now comfortable delegating to AI?
    - What mistakes did the AI make that you caught?
    - What would you do differently if you started over?
2.  **Document Your Learnings:**
    - **Prompt:** "Help me create a `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` document structured as: 1. What worked well, 2. What was difficult, 3. What I'd improve, 4. What I still don't understand."
3.  **Plan Your Capstone:**
    - Choose one of these or invent your own:
        - **Micro-SaaS:** Subscription tracker with Stripe integration.
        - **AI-Powered Discord Bot:** Summarizes conversations.
        - **Data Dashboard:** Visualizes live crypto/stock prices.
4.  **Create Project Spec:**
    - **Prompt:** "Help me create an `architecture.md` for [chosen project]. Include: data schema, API design, tech stack, and deployment strategy."

## Success Criteria

You have a reflection document and a detailed specification for a complex capstone project that uses everything you've learned.

## Beyond the Course

You are now equipped to:
- Design complex systems
- Direct AI to implement your vision
- Debug when things break
- Deploy to production
- Automate your own workflow

The next step is to build something ambitious. Remember: **You are the Architect. The AI is your construction crew.**

Good luck.
