## Objective

Set up your development environment and understand the tools that professionals use to manage code projects.

## Key Concepts

- **Terminal/Command Line:** The text-based interface to your computer. It's faster than clicking once you learn it.
- **Package Manager:** A tool that downloads and manages libraries (code written by others).
- **Virtual Environment:** An isolated space for each project's dependencies, so projects don't interfere with each other.
- **Git:** A time machine for code. Save checkpoints and never lose work.

## The Task

Install the tools and configure your workspace.

## Steps

1.  **Check Python:** Open Terminal and type `python3 --version`. If you see a version number (3.8+), you're good.
2.  **Install Git:** Type `git --version`. If not installed, download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
3.  **Prompt Your AI:** "I'm setting up a Python development environment. Walk me through creating a virtual environment called `venv` and activating it."
4.  **Follow the Steps:** The AI will give you terminal commands. Copy and paste them.
5.  **Verify:** When activated, your terminal should show `(venv)` at the beginning of the line.

## Success Criteria

Your terminal shows `(venv)` and you understand that this is your project's isolated workspace.
